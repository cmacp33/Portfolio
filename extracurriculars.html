        <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 25px;">UBC Solar is a student design team focused on designing and racing solar powered cars. The team usually competes at one or two major competitions each year, including the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) and the American Solar Challenge (ASC). The team is split into mechanical and electrical disciplines, each further split into specialized subteams. I was a member of the Power and Signals subteam which managed all electrical systems on the car except the main battery. The projects that I was frequently responsible for included circuit design, PCB design, PCB assembly and validation, embedded programming, motor simulation / control, and wire harnessing.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.15rem;">Growing up, I participated in many sports, including soccer, basketball, and track, but my favorite has always been kayaking. I loved the feeling of being able to take a stroke and glide along the water. I also enjoyed the high pressure and competitive nature of racing. Those two things made it the perfect sport for me. My passion for the sport and strong work ethic led to many successes, most notably earning me a spot on Team Canada in 2019 and 2021 (the 2020 season was unfortunately canceled due to COVID).</p>
        <p>While a strong work ethic came naturally to me, it was further developed through intense training. Practice often had two-four training sessions per day made up of paddling, running, strength training, HIIT, and swimming (reserved for winter when lakes are frozen). </p>
        <p>I also developed effective time management. Balancing school, other sports, and 20–30 hours (depending on training cycle and season) of training per week taught me to plan efficiently and use my time wisely. These skills allowed me to easily adapt to the demands of university and will carry over into the workplace. </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Finally, I developed the ability to stay calm and focused under extreme pressure. In short-distance races, all nine boats can finish within less than a second of each other, and even in longer distances, I have had ties down to three decimal places, requiring video playback to determine the final placements.Competing at high stakes competitions, where every thousandth of a second counts, taught me to not only handle pressure but thrive under it.</p>
