    <h1>FPGA iPod</h1>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>In this project I programmed an Altera DE1-SoC FPGA to function as a simple digital audio player. Songs that were stored as a sequence of 16-bit audio samples were first uploaded from a computer to the FPGAâ€™s flash memory. A finite state machine (FSM) was then implemented to reliably read the audio data from flash and stream it to the audio output interface. A PS/2 keyboard was connected to the FPGA, enabling controls such as play, pause, restart, skip, speed up, and slow down. Additionally, a PicoBlaze soft-core processor was programmed to drive the onboard LEDs as a real-time volume intensity bar, displaying the relative loudness of the audio signal.</p>
