    <h1>RL Underactuated Watercraft</h1>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project is to design, build, and control small solar-powered model watercraft to investigate reinforcement learningâ€“based control of underactuated boats. The focus is on developing and testing controllers for tasks such as station-keeping, docking, and collision avoidance under environmental disturbances.</p>
    <h2>Design Details</h2>
    <p>Project currently in progress. Engineering Physics capstone projects typically run across two years (4 academic terms) so additional objectives are typically introduced at the beginning of the second year.</p>
